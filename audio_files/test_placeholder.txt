# Test Audio File

This is a placeholder for a test audio file. In a real implementation, you would place actual audio files (MP3, WAV, etc.) in this directory.

For testing purposes, you can:

1. Download a small audio file
2. Place it in the audio_files directory  
3. Connect to ws://localhost:8000/ws/play/filename.ext

Example with a test file named "test.mp3":
- Place test.mp3 in audio_files/
- Connect to: ws://localhost:8000/ws/play/test.mp3
